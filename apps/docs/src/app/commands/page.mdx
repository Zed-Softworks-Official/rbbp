# Commands

RBBP has three simple commands. All commands require the **Ban Members** permission to use.

---

## /register

Marks a role as a "trap" role. When anyone self-assigns this role, RBBP will automatically ban them.

### Usage

```
/register [role]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `role` | The role you want to use as a trap | Yes |

### Example

```
/register Bonk
```

This sets up "Bonk" as a trap role. Now if any bot tries to give itself the Bonk role during onboarding, it gets banned instantly.

**Tip:** Start typing the role name and RBBP will show you matching roles to pick from!

---

## /unregister

Removes a role from the trap list. RBBP will no longer monitor this role.

### Usage

```
/unregister [role]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `role` | The trap role to unregister | Yes |

### Example

```
/unregister Bonk
```

**Tip:** The autocomplete only shows roles that are currently registered, making it easy to find the right one.

---

## /log-channel

Sets up a channel where RBBP will post detailed logs whenever it bans someone.

### Usage

```
/log-channel [channel]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `channel` | The text channel for logging | Yes |

### Example

```
/log-channel #mod-logs
```

### What Gets Logged?

When RBBP bans someone, the log includes:

- **User info** — username, nickname, avatar
- **Account age** — when the account was created
- **Join date** — when they joined your server
- **Bot status** — whether the account is a bot
- **Roles** — what roles they had
- **Trigger role** — which trap role they tried to assign

**Tip:** Setting up a log channel is optional but highly recommended so you can review bans.
