## Trap Roles

### What's a trap role?

A trap role is a harmless role you add to onboarding that looks normal but acts as a honeypot. Bots that grab every available role will grab it and get banned.

### What should I name my trap role?

Something that blends in with your other roles:

- **Bonk** (classic choice)
- **Verify**
- **New Member**
- **Ping Me**

Avoid names that scream "this is a trap" like "Bot Trap" or "Don't Pick This".

### How many trap roles can I have?

As many as you want! There's no limit.

### Should trap roles have any permissions?

No! Keep them completely powerless. They're just bait.

## Banning

### Will RBBP ban real users?

Only if they self-assign a trap role, which shouldn't happen in normal circumstances. RBBP checks the audit log to make sure the role was self-assigned, not given by a moderator.

### Can I undo a ban?

Yes. RBBP is just a regular ban. Go to **Server Settings** then **Bans** and unban the user if needed.

### What if I want to give someone a trap role?

No problem! RBBP only catches **self-assignment**. If you (or another moderator) assign the role to someone, they won't get banned.

### Does RBBP only ban bots?

No. RBBP bans **anyone** who self-assigns a trap role — bot or human. Most of the time it catches bots, but if a human somehow self-assigns a trap role, they'd get caught too.

## Logging

### Is the log channel required?

No, it's optional. But we highly recommend setting one up so you can review what RBBP catches.

### What information is in the logs?

Each log entry shows:

- User's name, tag, and avatar
- Account creation date
- When they joined the server
- Whether they're a bot
- What roles they had
- Which trap role triggered the ban

### Can I change the log channel?

Yes! Just run `/log-channel` again with the new channel.

## Troubleshooting

### The bot isn't detecting anything!

Check these common issues:

1. **Role position** — RBBP's role needs to be above the trap roles
2. **Permissions** — Make sure the bot has Ban Members and View Audit Log
3. **Registration** — Verify the role is registered with `/register`

### Commands aren't showing up!

Make sure the bot has been properly invited with the right permissions. Try kicking and re-inviting the bot using the [invite link](/getting-started).

### I accidentally registered the wrong role!

No worries. Just run `/unregister` and select the role to remove it.

### Will this catch bots that already have the role?

No. RBBP only detects when roles are **added**. If a bot already has the trap role from before you set up RBBP, it won't be caught retroactively.
