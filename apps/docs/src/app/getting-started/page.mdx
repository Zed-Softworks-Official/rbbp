## The Trap Role Strategy

RBBP works best with "trap" roles. The idea is simple:

1. Create a role that looks enticing (like "Bonk" or "Member")
2. Add it to your onboarding options
3. Register it with RBBP

Malicious bots tend to grab **every role available** during onboarding. When they grab your trap role, they get banned instantly. Legitimate users either skip the trap role or get it assigned by moderators.

---

## Step 1: Invite the Bot

[**Click here to invite RBBP**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1453927175525896363)

Make sure to grant these permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Ban Members | To ban malicious accounts |
| View Audit Log | To verify self-assignment |

---

## Step 2: Create a Trap Role

Go to **Server Settings** then **Roles** and create a new role. Call it something like:

- **Bonk** (recommended)
- **Verify**
- **New Member**

Make sure the role has **no special permissions**. It's just bait!

---

## Step 3: Add to Onboarding

If you use Discord's onboarding feature:

1. Go to **Server Settings** then **Onboarding**
2. Add your trap role as one of the options
3. Make it look like a normal choice

Bots will grab it automatically. Humans usually skip it or pick something else.

---

## Step 4: Register the Trap Role

Tell RBBP to watch this role:

```
/register Bonk
```

Start typing the role name and RBBP will show matching options.

Now anyone who **self-assigns** this role gets banned. If a moderator assigns it to someone, they're fine.

---

## Step 5: Set Up Logging (Recommended)

Create a channel for ban logs, then run:

```
/log-channel #mod-logs
```

Now you'll get detailed reports whenever RBBP catches someone:

- Who was banned
- When their account was created
- What role they tried to assign
- Whether they were a bot

---

## You're Protected!

That's it. RBBP is now watching your server.
