# RBBP

**Role-Based Ban Protection** — A Discord bot that catches malicious bots before they can cause damage.

---

## The Problem

Malicious bots join servers and **grab every role they can** during the onboarding process. They exploit misconfigured servers to give themselves permissions they shouldn't have.

## The Solution

RBBP lets you set up "trap" roles. When a bot self-assigns one of these roles, RBBP **instantly bans them**. Legitimate users don't self-assign roles, so they're never affected.

```
Bad bot joins → Self-assigns Bonk role → Banned instantly
```

## Quick Start

**3 steps. Under 2 minutes.**

1. [Invite RBBP](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1453927175525896363) to your server
2. Create a role called "Bonk" and add it to your onboarding options
3. Run `/register Bonk` to protect it

Now any bot that grabs the Bonk role during onboarding gets banned!
